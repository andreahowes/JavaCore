Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a byte stream?
    They are how we handle input and output of bytes.

2.) What is a character stream?
    They are how we handle input and output of characters.

3.) What two classes are at the top of the the byte stream hierarchy?
    InputStream and OutputStream

4.) What two classes are at the top of the the character stream hierarchy?
    Reader and Writer

5.) List at least three byte stream classes.
    BufferedInputStream
    BufferedOutputStream
    FileInputStream

6.) List at least three character stream classes.
    BufferedReader
    BufferedWriter
    FileReader

7.) What is a try-with-resources?
    It's a try statement that has the reader and/or writer declared in the try argument. It will automatically open and close the resources for you.

8.) What makes the BufferedReader different from the BufferedInputStream?
    It is the buffered input of a character stream as opposed to the buffered input of bytes.

9.) When would you use the read() method vs. the readline() method?
    I would use read() when I'm dealing with bytes or characters. I would use readline() when I'm dealing with a BufferedReader.
