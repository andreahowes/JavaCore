Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
    It allows us to reuse the same classes and methods for different types without having to rewrite code.

2.) What is type erasure?
    This is when the java compiler replaces the generic type with the actual type at compile type.

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
    ArrayList

4.) Can an interface be generic?
    Yes

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
    Bound generic types are when you only want certain types of variables to be able to be used (for example only subclasses of Number).
    Unbound generic types are when any type can be used.
