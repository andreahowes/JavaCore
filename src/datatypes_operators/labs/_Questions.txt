Answer the following questions:


1.) What are the names and uses of Java's eight primitive types?
    boolean: represents true/false values
    byte: 8-bit integer
    char: Character
    double: Double-precision floating point
    float: singe-precision floating point
    int: integer
    long: Long integer
    short: short integer

2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
    int x = 42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
    It will automatically convert into a double.

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
    You have to employ a cast.
    double y = 10;
    int x = (int) y;

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
    + - * / %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
    Relational operators are used for comparing two values. They result in a boolean value.

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    if (x<y) System.out.println("x is smaller than y");

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
    Logical operators evaluate two booleans. They result in a boolean value.

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
    int x = 1;
    int y = 2;
    int z = 3;
    if (x<y && y<z) System.out.println("x is smaller than y");

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
    x+=10;

11.) What data type is a String?
    Strings are an Object type.

12.) Are string mutable?
    No, strings are immutable.

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
    +

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?
    No, because String and int are different data types.

15.) What is an array?
    An array is a collection of variables of the same type, all held inside one object.

16.) What is the first index of an array?
    [0]

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?
    No

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?
    System.out.print(exampleArray[4]);

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.
    We can assign values after declaration of an array or, we can initialize the array with values when we create it.
    A) int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    B) int[] myArray = new int[5];
        for (int i = 0; i<myArray.length; i++){
            myArray[i]= i+1;
        }

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?
    Using a nested for loop.

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
