Answer the following questions:

1.) What is the if statement used for?

2.) What is good real life application of a switch statement?
    A good application would be the floors an elevator can visit- something with a finite number of options.

3.) What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?
    The while loop evaluates an expression and then executes the code. The do-while loop evaluates the expression
    at the bottom of the loop instead of the top, so the code is always executed at least once.

4.) What is the difference between a for loop and an enhanced for loop?
    The enhanced for loop is built for looping through collections and arrays.

5.) How do you create an infinite for loop?
    for( ; ; ){}

6.) What is the difference between the break statement and the continue statement?
    The break statement is used to break out of a loop.
    The continue statement skips the remaining code and iterates to the next iteration.

7.) Is there a limit to how many loops you can nest?
    No, all loops in Java can be nested within any other type of loop as many times as you want.

8.) Is there a limit to how many conditional statements you can nest?
        No, You can nest if statements as many times as you want.
