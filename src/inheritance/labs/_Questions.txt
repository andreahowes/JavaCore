Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
    Inheritance is where a class is creating using the methods and variables of an already existing class.

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
    So we don't have to rewrite code and to keep things organized.

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
    A class named DogBreeds with a subclass for Retrievers. The Retrievers will have methods for retrieving that not all dog types need.

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
    class Class2 extends Class1

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    As many as you want.

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
    It refers to the class above the class you are in.

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
    Superclass constructors first and then subclass.

8.) What is method overwriting?
    When a subclass changes the method the superclass gave to it.

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
    When the method doesn't fit with the subclass and it needs to be changed in order to fit into what the subclass is trying to do.
