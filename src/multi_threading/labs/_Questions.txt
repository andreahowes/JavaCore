Answer the following questions:

1.) What is a thread and why do we use them?
    It's the smallest unit of dispatchable code- this allows the same program to multitask as long as the tasks are on different threads.

2.) What are the two ways to create a thread?
    1) By extending the Thread class.
    2) By implementing the Run interface.

3.) How do you start a thread using the Runnable interface?
    class thisThread implements Runnable{
        public void run(){}
    }
        //the thread object with start() will be created in a different class

4.) How do you start a thread using the Thread class?
    class thisThread extends Thread{
        public void run(){}
    }
        //the object also needs to be created and start()

5.) How do you change a thread priority?
    Use setPriority() method- it takes an int between 1 (low) and 10 (high) to set priority.
    Thread.currentThread().setPriority(1);

    OR usd built in static final variables: Thread.currentThread().setPriority(Thread.MIN_PRIORITY) etc.
