Answer the following questions:

1.) What is an interface?
    An interface is a group of methods, similar to a class, that have an empty body.

2.) Why are interfaces implemented?
    They enforce standards by forcing classes and objects that are created to implement that interface and have certain methods.

3.) What is the implement keyword used for?
    public class Class1 implements Interface1{}
    The implement keyword is used to connect a class to an interface.

4.) How many interfaces can class implement?
    As many as you want.

5.) Write a simple interface with one method.

    public interface Park{
        public void getFunding();
    }

6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe it's purpose.
    A magazine company could have a membership interface that enforces that every class (onlineMembershipClass or inPersonMembershipClass)
    must have a name for the member and a method by which to ask the user for money monthly.

7.) What is wrong with the following interface?

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
            return x + y;
        }
    }

    Methods in interfaces aren't supposed to have bodies. It should just have the method definition:
    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        sum(int x, int y);
    }
